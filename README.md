This model simulates how clozapine affects the firing rate of dopaminergic (DA) neurons—and therefore the production of dopamine—in schizophrenic patients. It is based on a multi-compartmental model of a DA neuron, in which the firing rate of the neuron is primarily based on the L-type Ca+2 current and the A-type K+ currents; the model is cited below.
